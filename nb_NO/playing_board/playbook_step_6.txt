Flesh out the idea

The Storyboard section of the board is your sandbox to describe and illustrate the idea you are working on. Try to make notes and sketches to show how, where and when the concept works and looks, and what it might feel like to use it. Imagine a story which depicts a use case for your object, you can sketch each step on a post-it and stick them in the boxes.
